        <h2>Project Background</h2>
        <p>
          Our team set out to design an educational game to help reinforce algebraic concepts for middle school students.
          So-called "edutainment" games have been shown to be effective in engaging students and improving learning outcomes.
          They also provide young students a unique opportunity to apply concepts to a practical, stimulating problem.
        </p>
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
          Our Game, Mini Golf Mania, is an interactive,
          web-based application designed to teach algebra concepts through engaging gameplay.
          It is intended as a standalone educational product,
          leveraging mini golf gameplay to create a fun and interactive learning experience. 
          By solving mathematical equations, players influence the trajectory of a golf ball,
          merging gameplay with core algebraic principles.
          MGM is accessible via standard web browsers and is compatible across desktop and mobile platforms,
          making it a versatile educational tool for students.
        </p>
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
        The intended users for MGM are students primarily in grades 7 and 8, who are learning Algebra I.
        These users are expected to have a foundational understanding of algebraic principles,
        including linear equations and expressions, which are typically introduced in 7th grade.
        Users should be comfortable working with linear equations in point-slope, slope-intercept,
        and standard form. By 8th grade, students are expected to have developed proficiency with linear relationships,
        equations and expressions as recommended by the Massachusetts Department of Educationâ€™s advisory on the Mathematics Curriculum Framework.
        The game is designed to challenge and engage users who are proficient in algebraic reasoning therefore MGM targets higher-level middle school students who can apply mathematical concepts to solve interactive challenges.
